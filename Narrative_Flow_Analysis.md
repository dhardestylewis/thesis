## Key Figures Introduction Timeline

### Political Figures

- **Leslie Pool**: Dramatic introduction Part I, underused thereafter
- **Zohaib Qadri**: Part II elections, not mentioned again
- **Doug Becker**: Part II (CodeNEXT killer), Part V (lawsuit strategy)

- **AURA**: PROBLEM - First appears as acronym (Part IV, line 192), explained later (Part V, line 220)
- **Austin Neighborhoods Council**: Part V, properly introduced
- **Community Not Commodity**: Part V, minimal development

### Missing Introductions
- **T.C. Broadnax** - appears without context
- **Planning Commission members** - anonymous quotes without setup
- **Various council members** - mentioned without introduction

## Structural Problems by Section

### Introduction
- ✗ Doesn't define key terms (CodeNEXT, HOME, AURA)
- ✗ Jumps into statistics before setting scene
- ✓ Does establish housing crisis as driver

### Parts I-III: Setup (Generally Strong)
- ✓ Good narrative flow
- ✓ Building tension through crisis → politics → state intervention
- ✗ Some key concepts mentioned before explained

### Parts IV-VI: Technical Middle (Loses Narrative)
- ✗ Becomes list-heavy, loses story
- ✗ Commission section feels isolated
- ✗ Density bonus section very technical, disconnected

### Parts VII-VIII: Outcomes and Technology (Problematic)
- ✗ Part VII reverts to bullets often
- ✗ Part VIII appears suddenly, uses fake quotes
- ✗ Technology section contradicts manuscript purpose

### Part IX-X: Recent Reforms and Conclusion (Mixed)
- ✓ Returns to narrative for reforms
- ✗ But uses bullets extensively
- ✗ Multiple "conclusion" sections confusing

## Where to Add Tables/Figures

### Table 1: Timeline of Major Reforms (After Part IX introduction)
- Date | Reform | Vote | Key Provisions | Impact

### Table 2: Density Bonus Program Comparison (Part VI)
- Program | Affordability % | Income Target | Duration | Fee Option | Utilization

### Figure 1: Housing Production Comparison (Part VII)
- Bar chart: Austin vs peer cities permits per capita

### Figure 2: Political Shift Visualization (Part II)
- Before/after council composition 2020 vs 2024

### Table 3: State Laws Impact Matrix (Part III)
- Law | Year | Effect on Austin | Housing Impact

### Figure 3: Rent/Price Trajectory (Part I)
- Dual axis: home prices and rents 2020-2025

## Missing Connections to Strengthen

1. **Leslie Pool's conversion** should be referenced when discussing:
   - Each major HOME vote
   - Political sustainability questions
   - NIMBY collapse

2. **CodeNEXT failure** should frame:
   - Why HOME succeeded where it failed
   - Importance of state law changes
   - Commission vs council tensions

3. **Density bonus complexity** should connect to:
   - Why deep affordability fails
   - Market response limitations
   - Need for mandatory tools

4. **Technology section** needs:
   - Earlier setup about Austin's smart city ambitions
   - Connection to planning process challenges
   - Reframe from "insurmountable" to "significant challenges"

## Citation Needs by Section

### Highest Priority (Likely False/Unverifiable)
- Line 555: Lauren Middleton-Pratt "hypothetical" quote - DELETE
- Line 518: Joydeep Ghosh research - VERIFY OR DELETE
- Line 557: "2 of 11 council members" claim - VERIFY OR DELETE
- Lines throughout: Anonymous commissioner quotes - VERIFY OR MARK AS PARAPHRASED

### Statistics Needing Sources
- 75% EMS medics living outside city
- 68% teachers outside AISD
- All turnout percentages
- Vacancy rates (9.92% specific)
- 25,000 multifamily permits 2022
- "Austin built more than any city 2023"

### Votes/Dates Needing Verification
- All council votes (specific tallies)
- All ordinance dates and numbers
- Election results and percentages
- Commission meeting dates

## Recommended Restructure

### New Introduction Sequence
1. **Opening hook**: Austin's transformation in context
2. **Define key terms**: CodeNEXT, HOME, AURA, etc.
3. **Introduce major players**: Watson, Pool, Becker
4. **Preview narrative arc**: Crisis → Realignment → Reform → Challenges
5. **Thesis statement**: What this case reveals

### Narrative Through-Lines to Maintain
1. **Crisis drives change** (establish early, reference throughout)
2. **Political courage matters** (Pool's conversion as centerpiece)
3. **State paradox** (constraints enable and limit)
4. **Market response** (success and limitations)
5. **Implementation challenges** (good policy ≠ easy execution)

### Sections to Merge/Reorder
- Merge commission tensions into political transformation
- Move density bonus earlier, frame as tool limitations
- Integrate technology throughout rather than isolated section
- Single conclusion pulling threads together
