## Abstract

This thesis develops machine learning models to predict neighborhood opposition (NIMBYism) to housing development using Austin, Texas rezoning protest letters data from 2007-2025, with out-of-sample validation on 2018-2025 cases.

## Data

- **Training**: Austin rezoning protest letters (2007-2017)
- **Validation**: Austin rezoning cases (2018-2025)
- **Context**: Austin's housing policy transformation from NIMBY stronghold to YIMBY laboratory
