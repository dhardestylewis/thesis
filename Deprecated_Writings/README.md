# Deprecated Writings

This directory contains superseded drafts and working documents from the thesis development process. Files are numbered chronologically based on content analysis of revision markers (corrected data, updated dates, structural evolution).

## Numbering Scheme

| # | Item | Evidence of Order |
|---|------|-------------------|
| **1** | `Thesis_Proposal-OLD.txt` | Earliest draft: contains 75% EMS figure (later corrected to 70%), "May 1, 2025" single-stair date (later updated) |
| **2.1** | `Austin_Housing_Narrative-COMPREHENSIVE.md` | Source narrative content; corrected to July 10, 2025 single-stair date |
| **2.2** | `Austin_Housing-COMPREHENSIVE.d/` | LaTeX implementation of 2.1 narrative style ("sweltering July evening" intro) |
| **3** | `Austin_Housing-FACTCHECKED.d/` | Verification document with explicit correction notes (e.g., "The document claimed 75%...") |
| **4** | `Austin_Housing_Revised.d/` | Final polish: contains most updated data (6-story single-stair, July 10 effective date) |

### Parallel Documents (*.1, *.2)

Items sharing the same base number (e.g., 2.1 and 2.2) were developed in parallel rather than strict sequence. The `.1` suffix indicates which likely came first based on format (MD source → TeX implementation).
