# Thesis Project TODO

## Deferred Tasks

### Citation Audit
- [ ] Full audit of ALL `\cite{}` commands in Background-LONG.tex against references.bib
- [ ] Identify any remaining undefined citations
- [ ] Verify all cited references point to accurate, authoritative sources
- [ ] Consider consolidating duplicate entries for same facts

### Tables and Figures (Spring Thesis Draft)
- [ ] Tables 1-2 are included in Background-LONG.tex (Appendix)
- [ ] Tables 3-7 from `Tables_and_Figures.md` are NOT in Background-LONG — add when drafting thesis
- [ ] Figures 1-5 from `Tables_and_Figures.md` are NOT in Background-LONG — add when drafting thesis
- [ ] Cross-reference figure captions with narrative text

### Bibliography Consolidation
- [ ] Check if `Austin_Housing_Bibliography.md` entries are all in `references.bib`
- [ ] Remove `Austin_Housing_Bibliography.md` after consolidation confirmed


### Verification Approach (for reference)
1. Search for claims in target document
2. Check if cited reference exists in references.bib  
3. Externally verify factual accuracy via web search
4. Compare authoritative sources found vs current citations
5. Update bib entries or inline citations as needed
