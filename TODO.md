# Thesis Project TODO

## Priority Tasks

### P1 - Before Spring Draft
- [ ] REVIEW `CHANGELOG.md` items marked as UNREVIEWED
- [ ] Full audit of ALL `\cite{}` commands in Background-COMPREHENSIVE.tex against references.bib
- [ ] Identify any remaining undefined citations
- [ ] Organize `references.bib` with commented section headers:
  - Primary Sources - Government Documents (City, State, Federal, Court)
  - Secondary Sources - Academic Research (Books, UT Research, Other)
  - News Sources and Journalistic Accounts
  - Organizational Sources (Advocacy, Think Tanks)
  - Data Sources
  - Legal and Regulatory Sources

### P2 - Spring Thesis Draft
- [ ] Tables 3-7 from `Tables_and_Figures-TO_INTEGRATE.md` — add when drafting thesis
- [ ] Figures 1-5 from `Tables_and_Figures-TO_INTEGRATE.md` — add when drafting thesis
- [ ] Cross-reference figure captions with narrative text
- [ ] Verify all cited references point to accurate, authoritative sources

### P3 - Cleanup
- [ ] Rename `Austin_Housing_Bibliography.md` and decide what to do with it (deprecate or integrate)
- [ ] Consider consolidating duplicate bib entries for same facts
- [ ] Replace `[Author Name]` placeholder in all .tex files with "Daniel Hardesty Lewis"
  - `Background-COMPREHENSIVE.tex` (line 26)
  - `Deprecated_Writings/` files (not critical, but for consistency)
- [ ] Update `Tables_and_Figures-TO_INTEGRATE.md` "Pending" items when legislation passes:
  - Single-Stair Buildings (Table 1, line 13)
