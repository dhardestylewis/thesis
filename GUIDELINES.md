# Thesis Project Guidelines

> **CRITICAL**: At each prompt turn, evaluate whether the user's instruction should become a guideline. If yes, add immediately. Review this rule every turn. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:22]

> **CRITICAL**: NEVER perform `git rebase` or `git reset` without explicit permission. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:16]

> **CRITICAL**: NEVER abbreviate user prompts in `PROMPTS-LOG.md`. Record verbatim. If multiple prompts, use `[followed by:]` notation--never `...`. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:16]

> **CRITICAL**: Commit at every turn. After each response that modifies files, run `git add -A; git commit -m "..."`. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:25]

> **CRITICAL**: Push to remote periodically. Run `git push` after logical batches of commits. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:39]

> **CRITICAL**: Periodically review full GUIDELINES.md every few turns to ensure compliance. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:26]

> **CRITICAL**: Update PROMPTS-LOG.md at every turn with new user prompts. Never let prompts accumulate unlogged. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:36]

> **CRITICAL**: Maintain TODO.md for incomplete work. When user sends prompts before prior work is done, add items to TODO. Check recent prompts and PROMPTS-LOG for undone items. Move completed TODOs to TODO-COMPLETED.md. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:36]

> **CRITICAL**: Do not interrupt the user's view with walkthrough artifacts. When creating a walkthrough, do NOT use `notify_user` to request review of it. Maintain it silently. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 19:20]

> **CRITICAL**: Timestamp each individual prompt entry in `PROMPTS-LOG.md` at insertion time `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]`. (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:54]

> **META**: All new guidelines must be marked `(UNREVIEWED)` until user confirms review. [Added: 2025-12-12 18:16]
> **META**: All new guidelines must include insertion timestamp `[Added: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]`. [Added: 2025-12-12 18:16]
> **META**: When syncing external guidelines, MERGE with existing project-specific content--do not overwrite. [Added: 2025-12-12 18:16]

## P1 - Critical (Every Session)

### 1. Version Control Safety (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:37]
#### 1.1 Strict Prohibitions
- **NO REBASE/RESET**: NEVER perform `git rebase` or `git reset` without explicit, written user permission.
- **Data Loss Prevention**: These commands rewrite history and can cause irreversible data loss.

#### 1.2 Branch Hygiene
- **NO SWITCH IF DETACHED**: If in detached HEAD state, do NOT switch branches without explicit user permission.
- **Verify Before Switch**: Run `git status` before switching branches.

#### 1.3 Commit Hygiene
- **Verify Staging**: Run `git status` BEFORE every commit.
- **Atomic Commits**: Commit logically grouped changes with descriptive messages.
- **No Dangling Work**: Never leave uncommitted changes at end of session.

### 2. Citation Integrity (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 17:31]
- **Cite all references**: Every reference in References section must be cited inline.
- **Consistent format**: Use IEEE `[1]` format for CS. Do not mix with Author-Year.
- **Verify citations**: Inline `\cite{key}` must have matching bib entries.

### 3. LaTeX Compilation (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 17:31]
- **Compile at every turn**: After editing `.tex` files, recompile PDF immediately.
- **Clean rebuild**: If issues persist, delete `.aux`, `.log`, `.pdf` and recompile twice.

### 1. Requirement Compliance
- **Verify against Guidelines**: Ensure content aligns with `UP Thesis Guidelines` and `UP Outline`.
- **Check Constraints**: Monitor word counts, formatting requirements, and required sections (e.g., Abstract, Introduction types).

### 2. Fact Verification

#### 2.1 External Verification
- **Always externally verify factual claims** before marking as correct
- Use web search to confirm dates, names, percentages, and events
- Compare document claims against authoritative sources

#### 2.2 Source Priority
Prioritize sources in this order:
1. Government sources (texas.gov, austintexas.gov, capitol.texas.gov)
2. Academic sources (university research)
3. Established news organizations (Texas Tribune, KUT)
4. Official organizational sites

#### 2.3 Verification Steps
1. Search for claims in target document
2. Check if cited reference exists in references.bib
3. Externally verify factual accuracy via web search
4. Compare authoritative sources vs current citations
5. Update bib entries or inline citations as needed

### 3. Citation Integrity

#### 3.1 Citation Checking
- Verify inline `\cite{key}` commands have matching bib entries
- Search using multiple keywords (author name, title words, year)

#### 3.2 Adding New Entries
- Use verified external sources
- Note the verification date in comments

---

## P2 - Important (Regular Maintenance)

### 3. Bibliography Management

#### 3.1 Formatting Standard
```bibtex
@article{key,

  author = {Name},

  year = {2025},

  title = {Title}

}
```
- Blank line after `@type{key,`
- Blank line between each field
- Two-space indentation for fields

#### 3.2 Organization
Use commented section headers:
- Primary Sources (Government, Court)
- Secondary Sources (Academic)
- News Sources
- Organizational Sources
- Data Sources

### 4. Documentation (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:16]

#### 4.1 Session Tracking
- **Prompt Logging**: Append prompts verbatim to `PROMPTS-LOG.md`.
- **Timestamping**: New sessions use header `## YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM - Session Description`.
- **Full Fidelity**: Never truncate or use ellipses. Log exact full text.
- **Append ONLY**: Do not revise existing logs.

#### 4.2 Session Wrap-Up
- **Log Prompts**: Ensure all prompts are appended with timestamp.
- **Update TODO**: Verify completed work is checked off and moved to `TODO-COMPLETED.md`.
- **Final Commit & Push**: Stage, commit, and push to remote.

### 5. TODO Management (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:36]

#### 5.1 Insertion Policy
- **Prioritize Immediately**: Assess priority (P1, P2, P3) and insert accordingly.
- **Timestamp Insertion**: Append `[Added: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` to every new item.

#### 5.2 Completion Policy
- **Move to Archive**: When done, move from `TODO.md` to `TODO-COMPLETED.md`.
- **Timestamping**: Append completion timestamp `(Completed: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM)`.

### 6. Style Guidelines (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 17:31]
- **Avoid parenthetical statements**: Use comma-delimited clauses instead.
- **Avoid em dashes**: Use colons, commas, or en dashes `--`.
- **Consistent faculty titles**: Full title on first mention, then "Prof."
- **ASCII only**: Use `--` for en-dashes, not Unicode.
- **Hyphenate compound adjectives**: Use `black-box` (hyphenated).

## P3 - Housekeeping

### 7. Reference Formatting (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 17:31]

- **Inner Tasks**: Use `MM/DD-MM/DD` format for specific task ranges.

### 8. File Organization (UNREVIEWED) [Added: 2025-12-12 18:37]

| Suffix | Meaning |

### 9. Session Wrap-Up
- **Log Prompts**: Ensure all recent prompts are appended to `PROMPTS-LOG.md` with a timestamp, following full-fidelity rules.
- **Update Changelog**: Add a timestamped entry to `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing key changes, decisions, and completed tasks.
- **Review TODOs**: Verify all completed work is checked off in `TODO.md` and moved to `TODO-COMPLETED.md`.
