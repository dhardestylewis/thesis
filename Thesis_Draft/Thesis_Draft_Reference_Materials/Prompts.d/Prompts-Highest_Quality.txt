===========================================

did you actually search externally the factuality of each?

fix it

now delete critical corrections

write up the approach we just took then apply it to cehck Completion Summary against both Background and Submitted Thesis

push Thesis Proposal.txt into Deprecated

confirm that you actually search externally thos now correct entries

and for both the previous critical corrections and these are we citing those same references you just pulled? did you check the references we are now using? decide which between the two if they contain the same information is the better reference to keep citing in-line (though keeping both in the master references.bib)?

they may be under different keywords than you used to search

add the missing bib entries and ensure where they are cited inline these citations are used, notify me if doing so would potentially deprecate an existing citation for the same fact

defer the full audit for later by putting in a master TODO file at the top level

rename prompts.txt to Prompts.txt
irb content to IRB-SUBMITTED.txt

does the background LONG contain all the tables and figures?
now delete completion summary

is every Austin_Housing_Summary included in references.bib?
no instead place in the TODOs a check tables and figures when drafting thesis in the spring, that these tables and figures are not included in the background long
create a new folder named Thesis_Draft and rename Submitted_Thesis_Proposal to Thesis_Proposal-SUBMITTED

check that every sources mentioned in Austin Housing Bibliography is already included in the references.bib

fix this in references
lines 2847-3004

use greps to adopt a consistent formatting scheme throughout references.bib

TODO: organize references.bib to follow a similar commented organizational scheme as Austin Housing Bibliography

move into thesis daft  Backgroun LONG IRB SUBMITTED Master Sources Prompts references.bib Tables and Figures and  a copy of Thesis Proposal Submitted tl dir itself
Rename Tables and Figures Table_and_Figures-TO_INTEGRATE

mkdir Assignments_and_Proposal-SUBMITTED and move Assignments into it renaming it Assignments-SUBMITTED and Thesis-Proposal

Move Austin_Housing_Bibliography into Thesis_Draft
put in TODO rename that file and decide what to do with it

place a raw copy of all my prompts through this entire conversation appended to Prompts

also append to a new file and name that file Prompts-Highest_Quality place right next to Prompts renaming Prompts to Prompts-LONG
