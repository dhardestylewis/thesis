# Critical Corrections and Citations Needed for Austin Housing Manuscript

## Priority 1: False or Unverifiable Claims to Remove/Fix

### Completely Fabricated - MUST DELETE:
1. **Line 555**: "Austin Planning Director Lauren Middleton-Pratt (hypothetically) commented" - This is fiction, DELETE
2. **Line 518**: "Computer science professor Joydeep Ghosh" - Cannot verify this person/research exists
3. **Line 557**: "Only 2 of 11 council members expressed even theoretical openness" - Unverifiable speculation

### Unverified Statistics - Need Sources or Deletion:
1. **75% of Austin EMS medics lived outside city** - No source found
2. **68% teachers outside AISD boundaries** - No source found
3. **71% nurses commuting from suburbs** - No source found
4. **82% service workers outside city** - No source found
5. **Vacancy 9.92% by mid-2025** - Appears only in broker blogs, actual is ~6-6.2%
6. **25,000 multifamily permits in 2022** - Needs verification
7. **"Austin built more apartments than any U.S. city in 2023"** - Likely false (NYC/Dallas/Houston lead)

### Incorrect Facts to Fix:
1. **T.C. Broadnax hired "2022"** → Appointed April 2024, started May 6, 2024
2. **"Largest city to eliminate parking"** → "One of the largest" (San José did it Dec 2022)
3. **"Texas lacks impact fees"** → "Texas allows limited impact fees (Ch. 395 LGC)"
4. **"First outmigration since 1980s"** → "First time in ~20 years"
5. **14th Court of Appeals ruling "2021"** → March 17, 2022
6. **Single-stair effective "May 1, 2025"** → July 10, 2025
7. **D9 runoff "58-42"** → Actually 51.3%-48.7%
8. **Hispanic population "declined 2,000"** → Share fell but numbers grew slightly

## Priority 2: Legal/Technical Corrections

### Supermajority Claims:
- **INCORRECT**: "falling short of the supermajority needed to overcome a property owner lawsuit"
- **CORRECT**: The lawsuit was about notification requirements, not vote counts. The supermajority requirement applies to overriding protest petitions, not lawsuits.

### HB 2127 Status:
- **INCORRECT**: "pending before Texas Supreme Court as of October 2025"
- **CORRECT**: Third Court of Appeals upheld the law July 18, 2025; it's currently in force

### HB 24 Details:
- Comprehensive code changes are EXEMPT from protests
- For non-comprehensive changes: 60% threshold when adding residential (simple majority override)
- Old 20% thresholds remain for other changes (still 3/4 override)

### Borden Dairy Vote:
- **INCORRECT**: "10-1 vote March 2024"
- **CORRECT**: 7-1-1 vote on July 20, 2023

## Priority 3: Structural Issues

### AURA Introduction Problem:
- First mentioned by acronym (line 192) before full name (line 220)
- FIX: Define "Austinites for Urban Rail Action (AURA)" on first use

### Missing Definitions in Introduction:
- CodeNEXT - never defined before discussed
- HOME Initiative - mentioned without explanation
- "Tyrant's veto" - technical term needs definition

### Section Title Problems:
- "What Goes Up Must Come Down" - inappropriate
- Multiple "Conclusion" sections
- Bullet points instead of narrative in later sections

## Priority 5: Quote Verification

### Quotes Needing Sources or Deletion:
1. "We spend hours deliberating...only to be ignored" - Anonymous, unverifiable
2. All Moody's Analytics quotes - Need specific report
3. Austin Fire Department survey - Need source
4. Leslie Pool quotes - Verify from public records
5. Kirk Watson conference quotes - Need date/venue

## Priority 6: Narrative Improvements

### Convert Bullet Points to Prose:
- Parts VI-VIII heavily bulleted
- Technology section especially problematic
- Recent reforms section needs narrative flow

### Strengthen Connections:
- Leslie Pool story introduced dramatically then abandoned
- CodeNEXT failure should frame HOME success
- Commission tensions disconnected from outcomes
- Technology section appears from nowhere

## Priority 7: Add Tables/Figures
