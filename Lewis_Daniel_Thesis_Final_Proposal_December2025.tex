\section{Introduction}

This thesis investigates the patterns of neighborhood opposition to housing development in Austin, Texas, and evaluates the democratic implications of using predictive analytics to anticipate such behavior. The project asks: how can cities identify and understand patterns of neighborhood opposition, and what are the normative consequences of using algorithmic tools to manage this participation?

Austin, Texas faces an unprecedented housing affordability crisis that has fundamentally reshaped its political landscape. Between 2010 and 2020, Austin's population grew by 33\%, adding nearly 250,000 residents \autocite{census2020}. This growth, driven primarily by the technology sector, created severe supply constraints. By May 2022, the median home price reached \$550,000, up 79\% from January 2020. As of August 2025, prices have moderated to \$444,490 but remain unaffordable for most residents \autocite{unlockMLS2025}.

The research addresses a critical gap at the intersection of urban planning and algorithmic governance. As cities turn to technological solutions to streamline development, the use of predictive tools raises questions about democratic participation and civil liberties. The findings will directly inform policy in Austin---where Development Services could use insights to improve engagement---and establish ethical frameworks for other cities.

\textbf{Research Questions}

The project is guided by three questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] What demographic, geographic, and behavioral factors predict whether residents will oppose specific development projects?
\item[b.] How do different stakeholders perceived the legitimacy and utility of algorithmic tools in housing policy?
\item[c.] What alternative technological approaches could improve development processes without raising concerns about democratic participation?
\end{enumerate}

An important recent development shapes this work. In 2025, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 24, raising the valid petition protest threshold from 20\% to 60\% and eliminating the automatic supermajority requirement (effective Sept 1, 2025). While these changes occurred after our study period (2018-2025), they create crucial context: we are analyzing behavior under a regime that has now been substantially weakened but continues to operate in other states.

\section{Background}

Austin's governance structure complicates housing policy implementation. The city operates under a council-manager system where the mayor has limited executive authority. Passing controversial reforms has historically required council supermajorities to overcome property owner protests authorized by Texas law \autocite{cityaustin2010}.

Historically, neighborhood associations have mounted organized opposition to development using tools like valid petitions and public testimony. This opposition often correlated with neighborhood demographics, raising questions about equity. In response to the deepening crisis, Austin underwent a political transformation. The November 2022 elections delivered a pro-housing supermajority \autocite{tcclerk2022}. This shift enabled sweeping reforms: eliminating parking requirements citywide in November 2023 \autocite{axios2023parking}, reducing minimum lot sizes, and allowing density on corner lots through the HOME Initiative \autocite{pool2023}.

These reforms have generated measurable impacts, with apartment vacancy rates climbing to 10-15\% by 2025 \autocite{kvue2024vacancy}. However, implementation challenges persist, with permit volumes fluctuating and staffing pressures in the Development Services Department. Throughout this period, opposition tactics have evolved. Austin's unique position as a technology hub, home to major tech firms and a workforce of 180,000, provides a distinct civic context for debating the role of data in managing this conflict. This research contributes to literature on algorithmic governance and housing policy by separating the empirical structure of opposition from the normative question of prediction, providing evidence on the tradeoffs between efficiency and legitimacy that informs theoretical debates about technocratic city management.

\section{Literature Review}

This section organizes the literature around three themes corresponding to the research questions. Theme A addresses the determinants of neighborhood opposition; Themes B and C examine the possibilities and limits of applying machine learning to predict political behavior in democratic urban governance.

\subsection{Theme A: Homeownership, Local Interests, and Opposition to Housing}

William Fischel's ``Homevoter Hypothesis'' \autocite{fischel2001} provides the foundational framework: homeowners rationally oppose development that might reduce property values or alter neighborhood character, creating systematic political opposition to housing supply increases. McCabe extends this by showing that homeowner-dominated municipalities are more likely to restrict multifamily housing \autocite{mccabe2016}. Hankinson finds that even renters exhibit NIMBY attitudes when they experience ``price anxiety'' about future housing costs \autocite{hankinson2018}.

\textbf{How our research tests these theories.} Drawing on Travis Central Appraisal District records, City Council testimony, and tract-level demographic data, we will test whether Fischel's key variables (homeownership status, property value, tenure) and McCabe's (homeownership concentration) predict opposition behavior in Austin.

\subsection{Theme B: Machine Learning, Political Behavior, and Democratic Legitimacy}

The application of machine learning to predict citizen political behavior raises fundamental questions about democratic governance. Kleinberg et al.\ show that ML models can improve prediction of judicial decisions while raising concerns about feedback effects and the normative acceptability of delegating high-stakes judgments to algorithms \autocite{kleinberg2018}. Eubanks documents how predictive systems intensify surveillance of marginalized populations \autocite{eubanks2018}. Barocas and Selbst analyze how ML can produce discriminatory outcomes through proxy variables \autocite{barocas2016}.

\textbf{How our research advances this literature.} Our study contributes by constructing a parcel-level predictive model of zoning opposition while pairing that technical work with qualitative interviews that elicit stakeholders' evaluations of legitimacy and fairness.

\subsection{Theme C: The Limits of Algorithmic Governance in Democratic Contexts}

Kitchin's critique of ``real-time cities'' argues that data-driven management systems prioritize technocratic efficiency over democratic accountability \autocite{kitchin2014}. Schuilenburg and Peeters analyze how algorithmic systems subtly reshape who feels welcome to participate in public life \autocite{schuilenburg2018}. Zarsky argues that opaque, automated decisions undermine individuals' ability to understand and contest outcomes \autocite{zarsky2016}.

\textbf{How our research contributes.} Our qualitative interviews will examine whether stakeholders view NIMBY prediction as a legitimate planning tool or as surveillance that chills democratic participation. These findings will identify the democratic limits of algorithmic governance in housing and highlight alternative technological approaches that may improve development processes without profiling opposition.


\section{Research Design}

This study combines quantitative analysis of existing administrative records with new qualitative interviews and public meeting observations. This design allows us to both identify empirical patterns in opposition behavior and understand how stakeholders evaluate the democratic implications of using predictive tools to anticipate that behavior.

\subsection{Research Site Selection}

Austin, Texas provides an ideal research site for several reasons. First and foremost, Austin is unique among major U.S.\ metropolitan areas in maintaining comprehensive public records of protest petitions and formal opposition to zoning changes. A public information request survey of the top 50 major metros operating under similar state laws revealed that Austin alone has systematically preserved these records in a form amenable to parcel-level analysis. This exceptional data availability makes possible an empirical analysis that would be infeasible in nearly any other U.S.\ city.

Second, the study period spans both zoning stasis and dramatic reform. The concentrated reform period in late 2023, anchored by parking requirement elimination on November 2, 2023 and HOME Phase 1 passage on December 7, 2023, creates a natural experiment in how zoning liberalization affects opposition patterns. These reforms were followed by HOME Phase 2 in May 2024, which further expanded allowable density on corner lots and other properties. This variation allows us to examine whether factors predicting opposition remained stable or shifted as the policy regime changed.

Third, Austin's position as a technology hub with approximately 180,000 tech workers creates both the technical capacity for algorithmic governance and an informed civic discourse about its implications \autocite{efa2025,idc2024}. This context means stakeholders interviewed will likely have more sophisticated understandings of algorithmic tools than in cities with less civic tech infrastructure.

Finally, Austin's diverse stakeholder landscape, including active neighborhood associations, organized housing advocacy groups such as Austinites for Urban Rail Action (AURA), and a council-manager government structure requiring supermajorities for controversial reforms, provides rich variation in how different groups might perceive predictive tools.

\subsection{Quantitative Component}

\textbf{Data Sources, Linkage, and Management.}
The quantitative analysis will construct a parcel-level and owner-level dataset linking multiple administrative and public record sources:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Opposition records (2007--2025)}: Protest petitions, valid petitions under Texas Local Government Code § 211.006(d) (pre-HB 24), and formal opposition filings extracted from zoning case files via public information requests.
    \item \textbf{City of Austin development records (1966--2025, using 2007 onwards)}: Site plan cases and zoning review cases from the City of Austin Open Data Portal, including case outcomes, processing timelines, and parcel identifiers.
    \item \textbf{Travis Central Appraisal District records (2021--2025, optionally earlier years via PIR)}: Parcel-level property characteristics including assessed value, land use, and approximate ownership tenure \autocite{tcad_public}.
    \item \textbf{Demographic context (2000--2025)}: U.S.\ Census Bureau tract-level data including decennial census (2000, 2010, 2020) and American Community Survey annual estimates (2005-forward).
    \item \textbf{Public testimony (2015--2025)}: City Council meeting transcripts and archived ATXN video recordings.
    \item \textbf{Campaign finance data (2016--2025, optional)}: Campaign contribution and expenditure records from the City of Austin Open Data Portal \autocite{austin_campaign_finance_transactions,austin_campaign_finance_reports}.
\end{enumerate}

To maintain confidentiality and follow IRB best practices, we will implement a two-table structure: a \textbf{linkage file} (Table A) containing study\_id, names, exact addresses, and other direct identifiers, stored in encrypted, access-controlled files with access limited to the Investigator; and an \textbf{analytic dataset} (Table B) containing study\_id and derived variables without direct identifiers, used for all analysis and publication.

\textbf{Feature Construction and Variables.}
The analytic dataset will include three categories of predictors: \textit{property and ownership characteristics} (assessed value, homeownership status, ownership tenure, property type, appraisal protest history); \textit{spatial variables} (proximity to proposed developments, neighborhood demographics, location relative to council districts and neighborhood association boundaries); and \textit{behavioral and temporal variables} (prior participation in zoning testimony, campaign contributions, policy regime indicators). An additional category will examine \textbf{demographic differences between property owners and nearby residents}.

\textbf{Modeling Approach and Validation.}
We will implement and compare logistic regression as an interpretable baseline and tree-based methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees) that can capture nonlinear relationships. Model performance will emphasize metrics appropriate for rare events: precision-recall curves, F1 score for the positive class, calibration diagnostics, and ROC AUC.

To ensure temporal validity and avoid data leakage, we will use an \textbf{annual expanding window validation strategy}:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Year 1: Train on data through 2018, test on 2019, validate on 2020--2025
    \item Year 2: Train through 2019, test on 2020, validate on 2021--2025
    \item Year 3: Train through 2020, test on 2021, validate on 2022--2025
    \item Year 4: Train through 2021, test on 2022, validate on 2023--2025
    \item Year 5: Train through 2022, test on 2023, validate on 2024--2025
    \item Year 6: Train through 2023, test on 2024, validate on 2025
    \item Year 7: Train through 2024, test on 2025, predict 2026 (no validation)
    \item Year 8: Train through 2025, predict 2026--2027 (no testing or validation)
\end{itemize}

This mimics real-world deployment with annual retraining on accumulating historical data.

\subsection{Qualitative Component}

\textbf{Subject Selection and Sampling.}
The qualitative component will involve approximately 10 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders who directly participate in or are affected by Austin's housing development processes. We will use purposive sampling to recruit a diverse set of participants: 2 city officials/planners from Development Services Department; 2 neighborhood association leaders; 2 housing advocates from organizations such as Austinites for Urban Rail Action (AURA); 2 civic technologists with expertise in civic data or algorithmic governance; and 2 developers (optional). We do not claim to reach thematic saturation; the qualitative component is designed to surface major tensions rather than exhaust the space of views. Snowball referrals may be used to identify additional participants up to this target if needed.

\textbf{Interview Protocol.}
Interviews will be semi-structured, following the IRB-approved interview guide (see Appendix A), covering: participant's role and experience; perceptions of current barriers in development approval; awareness of and attitudes toward algorithmic tools; reactions to predictive modeling of opposition; concerns about fairness, transparency, and democratic legitimacy; alternative technological approaches; and conditions for acceptability. Interviews will last 15--30 minutes, conducted in person, by phone, or via secure videoconference.

\textbf{Observational Data.}
The study will include non-participant observation of public meetings over a six-month period, including live video attendance at City Council and Planning \& Zoning Commission meetings and review of archived ATXN recordings. Field notes will document how stakeholders discuss predictive tools, data-driven governance, and democratic participation concerns.

\textbf{Qualitative Analysis Plan.}
Analysis will follow an iterative thematic coding approach using NVivo or Atlas.ti. Deductive codes will be adapted from Grimmelikhuijsen and Meijer's (2022) legitimacy framework and procedural justice concepts. Inductive codes will emerge from close reading of transcripts. We will present representative quotations to ground key themes in participants' own words.

\subsection{Integration of Quantitative and Qualitative Findings}

The mixed-methods design allows us to triangulate findings. The quantitative component establishes what patterns exist in opposition behavior and which factors predict them. The qualitative component examines how stakeholders interpret the benefits, risks, and legitimacy of using those patterns predictively. Integration will occur at the interpretation stage, synthesizing empirical patterns with normative stakeholder evaluations to address the overarching research question.
